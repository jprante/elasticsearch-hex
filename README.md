# Hex bulk indexing plugin for Elasticsearch

This plugin for Elasticsearch converts JSON hexadecimal encoding (base16) to binary data for Elasticsearch bulk indexing.

It is a customized bulk API endpoint called `_bulkhex` and processes REST HTTP JSON bodies.

The JSON processing uses a custom XContent API.

## Compatibility matrix

| Elasticsearch    | Plugin     | Release date |
| ---------------- | -----------| -------------|
| 1.6.2            | 1.6.2.0    | Sep 30, 2015 |

## Installation

    ./bin/plugin --install hex --url http://xbib.org/repository/org/xbib/elasticsearch/plugin/elasticsearch-hex/1.6.2.0/elasticsearch-hex-1.6.2.0-plugin.zip

Do not forget to restart the node after installing.

# Example

See `HexPluginTest.java` for using the API.

    curl -XPOST '0:9200/_bulkhex'
    {"index":{"_index":"test","_type":"test","_id":"1"}
    {"hex":"4AC3B67267","nothex":"Hello HTTP World"}

The indexed document shows the base64 encoding of the decoded base16 text.

    {"hex":"SsO2cmc=","nothex":"Hello HTTP World"}
